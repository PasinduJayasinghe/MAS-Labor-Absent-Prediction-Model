# MAS-Labor-Absent-Prediction-Model
This is a data analysis and time series prediction that were based on labor absent records in Thulhiriye MAS Factory. 
Me and my friend Nimesh working on this project as a team to build time series model to predict the future daily absent count using 6 months of absent records starting from Aprail to September.
We used R Programming language.

## Data Sets
Here the excel file named "Absent Details - 06 month.xlsx" is the original data we were provided by the MAS HR official.
We did data data cleaning and converting using tidyverse package in R to transform this data set into more convenient form.
All other data sets were created according to our needs for a example, "cleaned data grouped by date with column total absent" data set was a cleaned data set that was grouped
by "Date" varibale to count daily absents ignoring shift wise absents.
